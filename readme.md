# Dr. SAX

Dr. SAX is an HTML to markdown converter that uses a [SAX-based parser](http://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2) to convert HTML to markdown. (SAX to MD.  SAX MD? DR SAX? GET IT?!)

![your project name is bad and you should feel bad](http://i.imgur.com/qgxiLco.png)

## Why?
There are a few node.js based html to markdown converters available, why do we need another?

1. [html-md](https://github.com/neocotic/html.md) and [upndown](https://github.com/netgusto/upndown) are both jsdom based for node.js. JSDOM is slow, and [has some memory issues when used in a loop](https://github.com/neocotic/html.md/pull/43)
2. Others use regular expressions to parse your HTML. Why hello Zalgo! Nice to meet you today!

## Usage

`npm install --save dr-sax`

```
> drsax = require('dr-sax');
> drsax('<p>Wow, this is an <b>awesome</b> HTML parser dude! You should <a href="http://yahoo.com">submit it to yahoo!</a>');
Wow, this is an **awesome** HTML parser dude! You should [submit it to yahoo!](http://yahoo.com)
```
